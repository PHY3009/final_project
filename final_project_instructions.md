## Final Project for PHY3009

Student’s final Project topic will be decided on in the first week and ideally fall under 
the umbrella of the student’s question. This will be done in consultation with the tutor. 
Students will work on the project over the duration of the course, applying what they 
learned in each class to their project with the daily assignments. Students will also be 
given 6 hours of in-class time to work on the final project at the end of the course. 
During these in class work-along sessions, students are encouraged to consult the tutor 
and each other for help when needed. The project will be done under version control and 
submitted as a repository to Github. This assessment will consist of a proposal (5%), the 
code and public repository (40%), a final written report (25%), and a 10 minute Jupyter 
notebook presentation and Q&A session on the the project (25%).

### Code and Public Repository Expectations

The scope of the project should at a minimum input or simulate some data, clean and munge
that data, and visualize the data (saving the visualizations as .pdf files). If 
appropriate, some statistical analysis should be performed and results output a table 
(.csv file). The visualizations and statistical analysis **must** be relevant for 
answering the research question from your final project.

**Repository**
* All code (Python, Shell and/or Make), associated documentation and licence should be
in a public Github repository.
* Repository must be well documented (someone unfamiliar with the project 
should be able to understand the projects purpose from the README.md's and comments in the 
code).
* Repository must be well organized, with code organized in a directory, data in another,
results in another, documents in another, etc. 

**Code**
* Code should consist of one or more Python scripts which take arguments from the user
(*e.g.,* input_file, output_file).
* How python script(s) are called and the arguments are passed to them are documented in 
a Shell or Make script. The projects README.md clear identifies the Shell/Make script and 
makes it obvious how to call it.
* Planning and documentation: logical flow of explanation of the algorithms used and 
proper commenting on what the code does. Docstrings should be provided for all functions.
* Readability: clarity of coding rather than quantity or efficiency of code, meaningful 
variable and function names, effective use of whitespace.
* Reusability: code should be composed of modular functions. Wheels should not be 
reinvented, if there is a library which contains a function or method to do what you want, 
it should be used.
* Accuracy: Functions should be validated via tests. Defensive programming should also be
employed to ensure appropriate use of code. 


### Final Project Report Expectations
* 2500 word written scientific report (not including the reference list nor figure Captions).
* Must contain the following sections (in order):
	a. Title
	b. Abstract
	c. Introduction
	d. Methods (code should not be included, but instead a link to the Github repo must be provided)
	e. Results
	f. Discussion
	g. References

* Document can be written in Markdown, Laytex, Word or Pages.
* The document should be technical, but clear enough that someone outside of your field 
could read it (define all terms and acronyms).
* Research question, hypothesis and conclusions should all be clearly stated.


### Final Project Presentation Expectations
* 8 minute presentation of final project using a Jupyter notebook
* 2 minute question will follow each presentation
* The presentation should concisely cover:
	a. Research question and hypothesis
	b. Methods used
	c. Results
	d. Outcomes and signficance
